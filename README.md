Nester API that provides a recursive way of iterating over a known or uknown number of lists and printing all the elements inside them.
The result is printed in an indented way unless the the opposite is specified. Add your list and the level of indention desired,
if no indention is wanted a boolean False argument can be passed to the function. If that is the case the indention level will be ignored.

Super basic python program.
